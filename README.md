### Connect4
A two-player connection game that uses fundamental Java constructs such as 2D arrays.

### Battleship
A strategic guessing game that utilizes a `Board` class to represent each cell and incorporates OOP concepts for optimized code.

## C Game

### Minesweeper
An interactive and appealing text-based interface for the game, using various C programming concepts such as:
